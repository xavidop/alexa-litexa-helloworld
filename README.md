This README is a quick-start guide to help you create, run, and deploy this Litexa project.

## Running / Development

* `litexa test`

This command will build and run your Litexa project against your Litexa tests

* `litexa test --watch`

This command will build and run your Litexa projects against your Litexa tests continually.

## Building and Deploying

* `npm install -g @litexa/deploy-aws`
* `litexa deploy`

To deploy your code you must specify the deployment module in your Litexa configuration. By default, Litexa 
configures your project to deploy with the `@litexa/deploy-aws` module for the `development` environment.

`--help` provides more information when used in conjunction with a command, e.g. `litexa generate --help`. When used
on its own, it provides general information about the Litexa CLI.
